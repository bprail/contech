EasyProf is a light-weight profiling tool built on top of Contech.
It's intended to profile OpenMPI applications and give insights to 
programmers about how they could further optimize their parallel code. 
However, due to limitations of current version of Contech, our 
implementations works better with other parallel computing 
frameworks (OpenMP, pthreads, etc.)
